function runs = contiguous(A,varargin)
%   RUNS = CONTIGUOUS(A,NUM) returns the start and stop indices for contiguous 
%   runs of the elements NUM within vector A.  A and NUM can be vectors of 
%   integers or characters.  Output RUNS is a 2-column cell array where the ith 
%   row of the first column contains the ith value from vector NUM and the ith 
%   row of the second column contains a matrix of start and stop indices for runs 
%   of the ith value from vector NUM.    These matrices have the following form:
%  
%   [startRun1  stopRun1]
%   [startRun2  stopRun2]
%   [   ...        ...  ]
%   [startRunN  stopRunN]
%
%   Example:  Find the runs of '0' and '2' in vector A, where
%             A = [0 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 0 2 2 1 0 0];  
%    
%   runs = contiguous(A,[0 2])
%   runs = 
%           [0]    [3x2 double]
%           [2]    [2x2 double]
%
%   The start/stop indices for the runs of '0' are given by runs{1,2}:
%
%           1     3
%           9     9
%          13    14
%
%   RUNS = CONTIGUOUS(A) with only one input returns the start and stop
%   indices for runs of all unique elements contained in A.
%
%   CONTIGUOUS is intended for use with vectors of integers or characters, and 
%   is probably not appropriate for floating point values.  You decide.
